# Hi, I'm Dominic 👋

I am a Web3 Developer focused on building at the frontier of **Privacy (FHE)** and **Capital Efficient DeFi (Uniswap v4)**.

### 🏆 Key Achievements

#### 🔐 Zama Monthly Developer Program — Winner (August)
**Project: [EmelMarket](https://github.com/devEMEL/emel-market-main)**
* Developed a **Confidential NFT Auction Marketplace** using Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (fhEVM) on Sepolia.
* Implemented a "sealed-bid" logic where all bid amounts remain encrypted on-chain, ensuring 100% privacy until the auction settlement.
* Solved the transparency issue of public blockchains for high-value asset auctions.

#### 🦄 UHI5 Hookathon — Co-Winner
**Project: Flaunch-lazy-lp**
* Contributed to a protocol designed to automate NFT-based revenue streams into **Uniswap v4 Liquidity Pools**.
* Utilized a modified `PositionManager.sol` to capture creator revenue and direct it into active AMM liquidity.
* Built a **Synthetix-inspired distribution engine** that tracks pool fees and reallocates them proportionally to creators based on their revenue contribution.
